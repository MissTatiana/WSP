				<dt>Q:What is the best method to buy my tickets?</dt>
				<dd>A:That’s easy .. buy online, it saves time, gas, and effort. At the time of purchase you may elect to have your tickets mailed, placed in Will Call, or the best method … is to print your tickets at home and avoid the hassles. Ticket prices are the same price at the Box Office or online but phone orders carry a $2.00 per ticket surcharge.</dd>

				<dt>Q: Why so I have to pay service charges?</dt>
				<dd>A: Service charges cover the expenses of box office personnel, call center personnel, computer systems, online web presence, ticket stock, phone systems, and a myriad of other costs associated with providing ticketing services to our patrons.</dd>

				<dt>Q: What aren't serives charged simple included in the ticket price?</dt>
				<dd>A: Ticket prices are typically set by artists and their management team while service charges are based on a percentage model calculated to cover the costs associated with providing the ticketing service.</dd>

				<dd>A: Will Call is where you stand in line, sometimes in the rain, to pick up tickets purchased online or by phone 1 hour before show time.
				IMPORTANT NOTE … Nearly all events allow patrons to print tickets at home to avoid standing in line. Please utilize this FREE service to avoid delays at the door.</dd>

				<dt>Q: Where is the Will Call located?</dt>
				<dd>A: Depending on event and/or the weather Will Call may be located at the Box Office window or just inside the front door.</dd>

				<dt>Q: Do I need any type of Identification to attend a show?</dt>
				<dd>A: Only if you’re picking up Will Call tickets or plan on enjoying an adult beverage will you be required to show your ID.</dd>

				<dt>Q: What types of Food and Beverages are sold?</dt>
				<dd>A: We have beer, wine, soda, water, coffee, etc. plus Kenny &amp; Denny’s BBQ concession stand serving great snacks and sandwiches. Come early and enjoy some great food before the show.</dd>

				<dt>Q: Is it possible to rent the theatre? Who can I contact?</dt>
				<dd>A: We rent the theatre out for different function. If you are interested in renting the theatre use the form on the contact page.</dd>

				<dt>Q: Are sponsorships available?</dt>
				<dd>A: Supporting the arts in Orlando is more than just a good gesture, it’s good business. Your sponsorship is a terrific way to receive prominent business recognition throughout the season to over 30,000 patrons as well as highlight your support for the type of family entertainment your target audience values—“personalizing” and linking your business and its unique message in a creative way. It also helps support our vibrant artistic community in Orlando by being a part of the newest and largest producing theater in Central Florida. The Plaza theatre stands to transform the theatrical horizon in Orlando and we are grateful that you are considering taking part.

				Sponsorship includes, but is not limited to, your business banner/logo on display in the Plaza’s lobby, your business logo on the Plaza’s collateral materials including the Show program, Show Posters and other promotional materials, discounts for your employees and customers, complimentary tickets to performances, your company listing and logo link on the Plaza’s website and invitations to special events.</dd>
